## NYU Off-Campus Apartment Review App  
  
#### Inspiration  


My inspiration from this app stemmed from the struggles I encountered when trying to find my own off-campus apartment. I found that a lot of the apartment listings online did not accurately reflect the actual condition of the apartment when I went to tour. Therefore, I wanted to create an app that encourages students to share their experiences with their off campus apartments and hopefully this will help other students be more knowledgeable about other neighborhoods and buildings that are suitable for NYU students.  
  
#### Description  
  
In short, this app allows users to leave reviews of their own apartment and it includes important information for apartment search such as number of bedrooms, bathrooms, amenities, and location. Users are also able to see all the other reviews of apartments other users have inputted. Users are also able to see budget options based on monthly rent, which may be useful for those that are looking for cheaper options. If a user would like to delete or edit their post, the respective links will take them to do the action they desire. 
  
### Disclaimer  

  
Please note that this is just the protoype version of this app. Even though this app is in its early stages, it still emncompasses the concepts we learned in class. Using Python with Flask, I was able to connect to MongoDB Atlas to create a database full of user's reviews that they inputted to share their own apartment experiences. Users are able to leave feedback, read feedback of other user's as well as their own, delete posts they do not wish to be shared, as well as see the cheapest apartments out of the reviews that were inputted.  
  
In future versions, I would like to add more database collections as well as more components to allow for user flexibility and eventually grow this app to be a large-scale application.
